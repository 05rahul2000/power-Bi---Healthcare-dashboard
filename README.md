# power-Bi---Healthcare-dashboard
# Overview
The PowerBI Healthcare Dashboard project leverages advanced data visualization tools to provide comprehensive insights into day case/inpatient and outpatient services. This project utilizes a variety of charts, calendar graphs, and key performance indicators (KPIs) to present data effectively. The project encompasses nine critical processes: requirement gathering, data collection, transformation and modeling, data visualization blueprint, dashboard layout and design, interactive and navigation features, testing, sharing, maintenance, and refresh.
# Processes Involved
1.Requirement Gathering:
Collaborate with healthcare stakeholders to understand the key metrics and data points needed for the dashboard.
Identify the goals and objectives for monitoring day case/inpatient and outpatient services.

2.Data Collection:
Collect data from various sources such as electronic health records (EHRs), patient management systems, and financial databases.
Ensure data integrity and accuracy through validation checks.

3.Transformation and Modeling:
Clean and transform raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis.
Develop a data model that integrates multiple data sources, ensuring consistency and reliability.

4.Data Visualization Blueprint:
Create a blueprint that outlines the structure and layout of the dashboard.
Define the types of visualizations (charts, calendar graphs, KPIs) that will be used to represent different data points.

5.Dashboard Layout and Design:
Design an intuitive and user-friendly dashboard layout that facilitates easy navigation and interpretation of data.
Apply visual design principles to enhance the clarity and aesthetic appeal of the dashboard.

6.Interactive and Navigation:
Implement interactive features such as drill-downs, filters, and tooltips to allow users to explore data in detail.
Ensure seamless navigation between different sections of the dashboard.

7.Testing:
Conduct thorough testing to identify and rectify any issues or inaccuracies in the dashboard.
Gather feedback from stakeholders to make necessary improvements.

8.Sharing:
Deploy the dashboard to relevant stakeholders, ensuring secure access and permissions.
Provide training sessions to help users understand and utilize the dashboard effectively.

9.Maintenance and Refresh:
Establish a schedule for regular updates and maintenance to keep the dashboard current.
Automate data refresh processes to ensure that the dashboard always displays the latest information.
